# Solitude-KDE
Plasma theme and color scheme

Completely reworked.
Now based on breeze instead of Materia.

Base colors are the same but there are subtle changes everywhere.
To use this theme set the look and feel to normal Breeze.
Set the Solitude plasma theme and also the solitude color-scheme.


Includes:
