I use the widgets from the Materia theme and I recolor them so if it wasn't for the Materia theme then I couldn't do any of this.
You can download the Materia KDE theme here:https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/materia-kde

Also in the screenshots there is the Newaita icons and they are available here:
